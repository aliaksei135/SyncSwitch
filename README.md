# SyncSwitch
A simple app to run a background service that periodically disables WiFi connection and allows accounts to synchronise through Mobile Data. 

## Example Usecase
WiFi connection is restricted (eg at Work) and blocks social media etc. , but you want to keep up to date with social media etc. This app allows you to stay up to date and recieve all your precious notifications, albeit with a slight delay, without relying solely on Mobile Data.
